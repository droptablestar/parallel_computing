reducer.cpp/hpp:
These are the core code of the reducers (obviously).

To compile:
   mpic++ -Wall -std=c++0x reducer.cpp -o reducer
To run:
   mpirun --machinefile machines -np <num_procs> reducer <input_file>

maketables.py: This is used to create tables. This will take as input the
	       number of processors and the size of the table per processor.


***As a note: tables sizes (per processor) around 100K seem to be haiving
***problems. All table sizes used for testing were 50K per proc.***

test.py: This takes as input a file and computes the reduction. This
	  was used to check the accuracy of the MPI results.

results.txt: These are the results of testing by processor size with tables
	     of the same size.

tests/:	This directory contains the test files used.
results.pdf: A chart of the results.
